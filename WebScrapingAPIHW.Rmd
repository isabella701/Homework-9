# 1) Show and use a census API key that gives you access to the ACS data. Do not use my API key, use and show your own key.

# 2) Using ACS census data from 2015, show and use R code to do the following:
# a) Produce a tibble that shows the median income estimates and the margin of errors for white males who are 35-44 in the counties of California.  
# The required variable code starts with the characters BO1OO1. Use the table to find the other characters.
v2 <- load_variables(2015, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

ca_35to44 <- get_acs(geography = "county",

              state = "CA", 
              year = 2015)
ca_35to44

# b) Use a dplyr functions to change your table of part a so that it reflects estimates that are greater than $30,00 dollars and list the estimates in descending order.

ca_35to44%>%
  filter(estimate > 30000)%>%
  arrange(desc(estimate)) -> ca2
ca2

# c) Using the tibble that you produced in part b, use and show R code that will show the county that has a median income estimate of 51644 and a margin of error of 667.
  
ca2%>%
  filter(estimate == 51644, moe == 667)
# Alameda County

# d) Use and show ggplot coding that will produce the following boxplot for the data that you generated for part b.

ggplot(data = ca2) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y=estimate), fill = "red") +
  coord_flip()

# e) Use and show R code that will produce the following graph for the data generated in part b
ca2%>%
  mutate(NAME = gsub("County, California", "", NAME)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(NAME, estimate))) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = estimate - moe, xmax = estimate + moe)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Median Income for White Males by County",
       subtitle = "2014-2018 American Community Survey",
       y = "",
       x = "ACS estimate (bars represent margin of error)")
